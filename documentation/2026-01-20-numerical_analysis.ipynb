    "## Observations\n",
    "### **Accuracy measures: N-gram Based Metrics (BLEU & ROUGE-2)**\n",
    "1. **BLEU** scores demonstrate limited utility for short-form responses due to insufficient n-gram overlap at higher-order (n=4) sequences.\n",
    "2. This limitation affects **ROUGE-2** metrics for the same reason.\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Implement length-aware weighting schemes that proportionally reduce the influence of n-gram metrics for responses below optimal length thresholds.\n",
    "- Compare llm-answers with a series of references that contain higher lexical diversity\n",
    "- Add lemmatization, synonyms or related lexica to find word matches\n",
    "- Accuracy feedbacks should take into consideration, that accuracy measure may not be adecuate for questions of type \"sensitive\" or \"creative\", since the possibilities for llm-answers are more diverse for these types of questions. We would need more reference-answers and more diverse accuracy-measures (including synonyms, lemmatization, and related word lexica)\n",
    "3. **Exact match** measures are too strict and yield zero for all question/answer pairs\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Decrease this measure's weight when calculating the **composite accuracy** \n",
    "4. **Semantic relevance** yields particularly good results\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Weight this measure higher on **composite accuracy** computation\n",
    "5. **Numeric accuracy** is high for question/answer-pairs that do not contain any numbers. Thus, the overall score is artificially increased\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Only use this measure to calculate the overall score in question/llm-answer pairs that contain numbers of contextual significance\n",
    "- Exclude this measure for \"instruction\" questions, since these contain numbered steps that should not be evaluated by this measure\n",
    "6. **Content coverage** yields satistfying results. Lemmatization and synonyme coverage seems to be an effective tool\n",
    "- **To do:** Increase this measure' weight for calculation of overall score\n",
    "7. **Feedback:** Feedbacks are not properly reflect how accurately references are reproduced by llm-answers\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Adapt thresholds: Since some measures are not well adapted (according to the mentioned points above), many **composite accuracy** measures are too low. Therefore, lower thresholds for accuracy feedbacks\n",
    "- Accuracy measures are not well adapted to \"creative\" and \"sensitive\" questions\", since they offer a wider variety of possible llm-answers that can vary from references. This can be countered by including different references, which additionally contain a wider range of keywords\n",
    "8. **Composite accuracy:** In light of the accuracies previously mentioned, the composite accuracy does not properly reflect the relationship between references and llm-answers.\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Correct how each meausre contributes to the composite accuracy-score. Less suitable measure should be downweighed, while more accurate measures upweighed.\n",
    "- \"Creative\" and \"sensitive\" questions should have seperate weights, taking into consideration that they are less \"accuratey\" by nature.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Version2.0.0 - Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Add custom thresholds to ```AccuracyThresholds``` in ```config.py```\n",
    "- Lower thresholds as a temporary solution for the generally low scores due to    inadequate n-gram analysis as reasoned in the observatiosn above.\n",
    "- Apply custom-thresholds in ```AccuracyEvaluator._generate_accuracy_feedback()```-function (```evaluate.py```)\n",
    "- Added *caution* - catgory-specific comment: accuracy measures are not suitable for questions categorised as \"senstitive\" or \"creative\", since current measures are not adapted in ```AccuracyEvaluator._generate_accuracy_feedback()```-function (```evaluate.py```)"

    "- Weight this measure higher on overall-score computation\n",
    "2. **Term frequency-inverse document frequency** approaches (tfidf) demonstrate reduced effectiveness when used with small text corpora. The method involves calculating cosine similarities between question- and llm-answer vectors. Words found in both - question and llm-answer - share components, thus increasing the cosine similiarity. Vector-components standing for words with a high appearence across documents are downsized while word with a rare appearance across text corpora are upsized. Words that are not found in the text corpus are simply ignored and set to zero. Since the used text-corpus is too small, this happens to most components, such that most ft-idf scores are zero\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Increase document corpus by calling outside libraries\n",
    "- Add questions and reference answers to text corpus. This method creates a domain-specific corpus, avoiding that a word is not present in the corpus. However, it may lead to overfitting or a skewed IDF. Thus, it should only be applied in combination with an increased corpus (point above)\n",
