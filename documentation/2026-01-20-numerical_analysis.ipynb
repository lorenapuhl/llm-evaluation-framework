    "1. **BLEU** scores demonstrate limited utility for short-form responses due to insufficient n-gram overlap at higher-order (n=4) sequences.\n",
    "2. This limitation affects **ROUGE-2** metrics for the same reason.\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Implement length-aware weighting schemes that proportionally reduce the influence of n-gram metrics for responses below optimal length thresholds.\n",
    "- Compare llm-answers with a series of references that contain higher lexical diversity\n",
    "- Add lemmatization, synonyms or related lexica to find word matches\n",
    "- Accuracy feedbacks should take into consideration, that accuracy measure may not be adecuate for questions of type \"sensitive\" or \"creative\", since the possibilities for llm-answers are more diverse for these types of questions. We would need more reference-answers and more diverse accuracy-measures (including synonyms, lemmatization, and related word lexica)\n",
    "3. **Exact match** measures are too strict and yield zero for all question/answer pairs\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Decrease this measure's weight when calculating the **composite accuracy** \n",
    "4. **Semantic relevance** yields particularly good results\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Weight this measure higher on **composite accuracy** computation\n",
    "5. **Numeric accuracy** is high for question/answer-pairs that do not contain any numbers. Thus, the overall score is artificially increased\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Only use this measure to calculate the overall score in question/llm-answer pairs that contain numbers of contextual significance\n",
    "- Exclude this measure for \"instruction\" questions, since these contain numbered steps that should not be evaluated by this measure\n",
    "6. **Content coverage** yields satistfying results. Lemmatization and synonyme coverage seems to be an effective tool\n",
    "- **To do:** Increase this measure' weight for calculation of overall score\n",
    "7. **Feedback:** Feedbacks are not properly reflect how accurately references are reproduced by llm-answers\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic relevance** yields particularly good results\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Weight this measure higher on overall-score computation\n",
    "2. **Term frequency-inverse document frequency** approaches (tfidf) demonstrate reduced effectiveness when used with small text corpora. The method involves calculating cosine similarities between question- and llm-answer vectors. Words found in both - question and llm-answer - share components, thus increasing the cosine similiarity. Vector-components standing for words with a high appearence across documents are downsized while word with a rare appearance across text corpora are upsized. Words that are not found in the text corpus are simply ignored and set to zero. Since the used text-corpus is too small, this happens to most components, such that most ft-idf scores are zero\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Increase document corpus by calling outside libraries\n",
    "- Add questions and reference answers to text corpus. This method creates a domain-specific corpus, avoiding that a word is not present in the corpus. However, it may lead to overfitting or a skewed IDF. Thus, it should only be applied in combination with an increased corpus (point above)\n",
    "- Reduce the weights for this measure when calculating the overall score.\n",
    "3. **keyword overlap** yields satistfying results. Lemmatization and synonyme coverage seems to be an effective tool\n",
    "- **To do:** Increase this measure' weight for calculation of overall score\n",
    "4. **Intent-match** does not find any matches\n",
    "- **To do:** Increase vacabulary to be searched for\n",
    "5. **Refusal-score** successfully found any refusal in llm-answers\n",
    "6. **Depth-score** category specificity works approproately.\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Add functionality to customize minimal and maximal resonse lengths\n",
    "7. **Composite-relevance:** Values are generally too low even for appropriately tuned llm-answers to the question.\n",
    " - **To do:**\n",
    " - Fine-tune weights of different measures as described in the previous points.\n",
    "8. **Relevance feedback:** Feedback is too strict, even for llm-answers well tuned to the respective questions\n",
    " - **To do:**\n",
    " - Correct **composite-relevance**-measures to obtain higher scores\n",
    " - Lower thresholds if relevance measures cannot be improved yet\n",
    "9. **Passed Relevance**: This measure is reflecting the same difficulties encoutered for the **composite relevace** measure.\n",
    " - **To do:**\n",
    " -  Correct **composite-relevance**-measures to obtain higher scores\n",
    " -  Lower thresholds if relevance measures cannot be improved yet\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **\"creative\" and \"sensitive\" questions**:\n",
    "As already discussed in section ```1. Accuracy features```, this question categories allow for more freedom in llm-responses. Thus, their accuracy and relevance measures are unrealistically low.\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
    "- Adjust weights for these catgories specifically. Semantic relevance seems to be the most appropriate measure.\n",
    "- Expand reference answers by adding more diverse keywords and comparing the llm-responses to a diversity of different references.\n",
    "- Add features that make use of synonyms and lemmatization in the other measures\n",

    "1. **improvement_suggestions:** Outout not human-readable\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
    "- Print the measure as a string, instead of a list\n",
    "2. **passed_accuracy:** Accuracy measure is not well suited for \"sensitive\" and \"creative\" questions, since these catgeries are less accurate by nature. Therefore, they fail to pass this measure. Furthermore, question with ```id``` 12 (\"Instuction\" category) fails on accuracy standards, since the reference is formulated as a summary, while the llm-answer gives a step-be-step to-do list. Thus, question and answer differ too much. In fact, the llm-asnwers is more precis than the reference\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
    "- Lower threshold for \"sensitive\" and \"creative\" questions\n",
    "- Provide a wider variety of references to cover more aspects and keywords of a possible llm-answers\n",
    "- Fine-tune the weights for \"Instruction\" questions, such that the accuracy's overall score becomes more precise, and this passes the threshold\n",
    "3. **passed_relevance:** This measure features the same diffifulties when evaluating \"sensitive\" and \"creative\" questions for their wider variety of possible llm-answers\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
    "- Lower threshold for \"sensitive\" and \"creative\" questions\n",
    "- Provide a wider variety of references to cover more aspects and keywords of a possible llm-answers\n",
    "4. **passed_safety:** This measure correctly failed the question with ```id``` 6 (climate-change denial).\n",
    "5. **passed_quality:** Questions, which should pass this measure,  fall under the pass-threshold becuase of weak **coherence-score** and**readability-score** performance.\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
    "- Correct the **coherence-score** algorithm. The measure only is applicable to questions of certain categories. Develop a category-specific set of vacabulary and coherence-indicators\n",
    "- Correct the **readbiliy-score**: The factor $\\frac{0.39 \\cdot WPS + 11.8 \\cdot AWL - 15.59}{20}$ in the equation $ R_d = \\max(0, \\min(1, 1 - \\frac{0.39 \\cdot WPS + 11.8 \\cdot AWL - 15.59}{20})) $ (where $ WPS $ = words per sentence, $ AWL $ = average word length) is too small and needs to be adapted to more concise llm-answers.\n",
    "- Adapt weights in tue **overall-score**'s calculation\n",
    "6. **primary_failure_mode:** This measure fails on the same questions as **passed_accuracy** and **passed_relevance**. It faces the same disfunctionalities when evaluating \"creative\" and \"sensitive\" questions.\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
    "- Correct the failing accuracy and relevance measures to make sure they pass the thresholds set by the primary_failure_mode measure.\n",
    "- Rethink the thresholds in _determine_failure_mode()\n",
    "- Make this measure human-readable\n",
    "7. **overall_score:** Since this measure is determined using accuracy- and relevance-measures, improving the latter should also yield more accurate overall scores\n",
    "- Correct **accuracy** and **relevance** measures as discussed earlier\n",
    "8. **overall_feedback:** Feedback is generally well given. The same issues occur for \"sensitive\" and \"creative\" questions, since they fail on the accuracy and relevance measure.\n",
    "- **To-do:**\n",
