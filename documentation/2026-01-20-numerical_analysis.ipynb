    "2. This limitation affects **ROUGE-2** metrics for the same reason.\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Implement length-aware weighting schemes that proportionally reduce the influence of n-gram metrics for responses below optimal length thresholds.\n",
    "- Compare llm-answers with a series of references that contain higher lexical diversity\n",
    "- Add lemmatization, synonyms or related lexica to find word matches\n",
    "- Accuracy feedbacks should take into consideration, that accuracy measure may not be adecuate for questions of type \"sensitive\" or \"creative\", since the possibilities for llm-answers are more diverse for these types of questions. We would need more reference-answers and more diverse accuracy-measures (including synonyms, lemmatization, and related word lexica)\n",
    "3. **Exact match** measures are too strict and yield zero for all question/answer pairs\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Decrease this measure's weight when calculating the overall score\n",
    "4. **Semantic relevance** yields particularly good results\n",
    "- **To do:**\n",
    "- Weight this measure higher on overall-score computation\n",
    "5. **Numeric accuracy** is high for question/answer-pairs that do not contain any numbers. Thus, the overall score is artificially score increased\n",

The method involves calculating cosine similarities between question- and llm-answer vectors. Words found in both - question and llm-answer - share components, thus increasing the cosine similiarity. Vector-components standing for words with a high appearence across documents are downsized while word with a rare appearance across text corpora are upsized. Words that are not found in the text corpus are simply ignored and set to zero. Since the used text-corpus is too small, this happens to most components, such that most ft-idf scores are zero\n",

    "**What TF-IDF Captures**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection-aware**: Score depends on other documents\n",
    "2. **Exact-match only**: No understanding of synonyms\n",
    "3. **Downweights common words**: \"the\", \"a\", \"is\" get low weights\n",
    "4. **Highlights distinctive terms**: Rare words get high weights\n",
    "\n",
    "**When TF-IDF Works Best**:\n",
    "- Document retrieval/search engines\n",
    "- When term exactness matters (e.g., technical terms)\n",
    "- With large document collections\n",
    "- For finding documents with similar distinctive vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- No semantic understanding (\"car\" ≠ \"automobile\")\n",
    "- Sensitive to spelling variations\n",
    "- Doesn't understand word order beyond bag-of-words"
