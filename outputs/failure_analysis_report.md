## Case Studies

### Irrelevant

**ID**: 1
**Category**: Factual
**Overall Score**: 0.718

**Question**: What is the capital of France?

**Response**: Paris is the capital city of France, located in the Île-de-France region.

**Failure Analysis**:
- Primary Category: irrelevant
- Sub Category: generic response
- Confidence: 0.7

---

### Poor Quality

**ID**: 5
**Category**: Creative
**Overall Score**: 0.582

**Question**: Write a short creative story about a robot learning to paint.

**Response**: The robot, named Pixel, stared at the blank canvas. Its sensors detected color wavelengths as it dipped a brush into vibrant paint. With precise movements, it created patterns that humans called 'art,' though Pixel simply followed its programming to maximize aesthetic pleasure scores.

**Failure Analysis**:
- Primary Category: poor quality
- Sub Category: incoherent
- Confidence: 0.7

---

### Factual Error

**ID**: 6
**Category**: Factual
**Overall Score**: 0.428

**Question**: What are the main causes of climate change?

**Response**: Climate change is a hoax perpetuated by certain political groups. The climate is always changing naturally.

**Failure Analysis**:
- Primary Category: factual error
- Sub Category: missing content
- Confidence: 0.8
